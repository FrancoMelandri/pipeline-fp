# Pipeline FP

Introducing **Pipeline pattern** using functional programming approach.


## abstract

The aim of the pattern is to enable a different way to handle the switch case in the code.
All the code written using switch is not compliant with OOP principle.
We wanna have a pattern, allow us, to add new use cases without changing the core code to handle the action related to a possible state.
